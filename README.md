# coding-portfolio

## Description

This weekend I began to build my first coding portfolio. The goal is to have a place to show off the amazing coding projects that I will eventually be creating. The hope is I can take this portfolio to companies to show them that I have the technical know-how and prowess to succeed in the roles I'm applying to. Of course, this involves me creating my first html and css files from screatch. However, this solves the problem of creating this site later down the road, and I've learned a lot about how to retrace my steps when I make errors and to constantly test little changes to see how they appear in the browser.

## Installation

No installation is required, after all you need only open the site in your browser of choice!

## Credits

I worked with a tutor named Dennis Itua on Tuesday for some final advice. Drew's speed run also proved to be helpful once more: https://zoom.us/rec/play/MWd80lmtiFLuNvQ3s_IT1M8T3w-erXAFJwUUYp8KwK6OiQ0b3C0MFKhwra3DTTD2wosd7ORmZ6Kj_68p.nmRLDIoKJnV5F9mB?startTime=1650867874000&_x_zm_rtaid=yr12smkwSPOFjV-iipMw0Q.1650864714070.e9486ecb0d64e3c7a6f6778698a6daef&_x_zm_rhtaid=930
